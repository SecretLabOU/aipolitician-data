She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker, and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church. Warren has described her early family life as teetering \"on the ragged edge of the middle class\" and \"kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails.\" She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist. Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City.",

After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building. Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant. Warren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16. She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert \"Jim\" Warren, whom she had met in high school. Warren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM.",

      "text": "Warren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the Notre Dame Law Review, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted. But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law. According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts.",

In 2004, she published an article in the Washington University Law Review in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy. Warren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law.",

This simply cannot be allowed to happen.\"",

Fellow journalist Brian Stelter concurred with Green's analysis that Warren (as well as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio–Cortez) had \"helped lead an economic 'backlash' to the 2008 financial crisis that pulled the [Democratic] party leftward.\" After the 2016 election of Donald Trump placed the national Democratic Party in a political wilderness as both the opposition to the president and the minority party in both chambers of the Congress, many commenters saw Warren as one of the de facto leading figures in a party that lacked a clear singular post-Obama leader.",

In February 2021, Jeff Bridgood observed that the administration appeared more receptive to Warren's input than the Obama administration had been, reflecting how the party had become more in line with her political philosophy than it had been when she first rose to political prominence. During the Biden administration, Warren has continued to be a prominent voice within her party. === Protégés ===\nWarren has mentored several people who have gone on to hold notable political office.

During his law school studies, former U.S. Representative Joe Kennedy III considered Warren a mentor. Boston City Council president Ruthzee Louijeune has also been described as a Warren protégée and served as senior counsel to Warren's presidential campaign before running for city council. === Influence on appointments in Democratic presidential administrations ===\nWarren strongly believes that \"personnel is policy\": that the policy of a presidency is shaped by who a president appoints to their administration. She has influenced President Obama, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and President Biden on the matter of staffing presidential administrations.",

In his 2024 book, Stern noted that after Warren (bullish on her own 2016 prospects of winning a presidential election) had declined grassroots efforts to draft her into a candidacy. Recognizing that Clinton stood of becoming the party's nominee, Warren quietly worked to influence how she might staff an administration. In 2019, Alex Thompson reported in Politico on Warren's efforts ahead of the 2016 election to pressure Clinton on potential appointees. Thompson described Warren's theory on political power as \"combining tough, often hyperbolic rhetoric to create leverage with quieter, hands-on, person-to-person outreach.\"",

A number of Warren's acolytes have served in the Biden administration, including Bharat Ramamurti (a former economic policy advisor to Warren) and Sasha Baker (a former senate and campaign policy advisor to Warren on national security).

In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt. In an article in The New York Times, Jeff Madrick said of the book:\n\n The authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children ... their main thesis is undeniable.",

More clearly than anyone else, I think, Ms. Warren and Ms. Tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live. In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. The study was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged its methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.

The nearly 1,000-page bill reformed and continued various programs of the Department of Agriculture through 2018. The $1 trillion bill expanded crop insurance for farmers by $7 billion over the next decade and created new subsidies for rice and peanut growers that would kick in when prices drop.[152] However, cuts to the food stamp program cut an average of $90 per month for 1.7 million people in 15 states.[152] Warren was one of nine Democratic senators who voted against the bill.",

The bill to reopen the government, H.R. 2775, lifted the $16.7 trillion debt limit and funded the government through January 15, 2014. Federal employees also received retroactive pay for the shutdown period. The only concession made by Senate Democrats was to require income verification for Obamacare subsidies.[156] The final vote on H.R. 2775 was 81-18, with all 18 votes against the bill from Republican members.

I won’t stop fighting until everyone is covered, no one goes broke paying a medical bill or filling a prescription, and families don’t have to bear the cost of heartbreaking medical disasters on their own.\nRead more\nLeveling the Economic Playing Field\nI’ve spent my career fighting to level the playing field for working families in America. As a U.S. Senator, I’m working hard to build an economy that works for everyone.\nRead more\nEquality and Justice for All\nIn America, everyone should be treated equal in the eyes of the law.

She received vice presidential endorsements from RootsAction and the Progressive Democrats of America.[187] In a June letter to Joe Biden (D), the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, the two organizations said that Warren would bring \"decades of experience and a track record of leadership on issues from the Green New Deal to fighting corporate greed and corruption – issues that excite the progressive voters you'll need to win the White House.\"[187]\nPolitico wrote, \"[Warren's] experience setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ... [has] given [her] deep know-how of the bureaucratic levers of power in the executive branch, which could be appealing to a potential Biden administration that would have its hands full with twin economic and public health crises.\"[188]\nWarren was mentioned as a possible Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2016, as well. On July 22, 2016, Hillary Clinton (D) announced that she had selected U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) as her running mate.[189]",
